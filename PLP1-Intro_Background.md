_Perl_

Perl is a high-level, loosely-typed programming that is meant to be general-purpose. It is an interpreted
language (not compiled), and does not use a virtual machine. It is often referred to as a scripting
language because it is designed so that useful, powerful programs can be written in only a few lines of
code, although it can also be used for much bigger projects.

There are currently two concurrent (but different) versions of Perl available: Perl 5, which is considered
by most to be "mainstream" Perl, and Perl 6, which started as a redesign of Perl 5 but has since
become, essentially, a completely separate language. Perl 6 is still being developed.

_History_

Perl was created by Larry Wall in the 1980's because the tools available at the time (sed, awk, grep,
etc.) were incapable of easily doing what he wanted them to. Rather than spend a lot of time forcing those 
language to do what he wanted, he wrote his own programming language instead.

_Usage_

According to "Learning Perl: 6th edition", Perl is best for projects that are "about 90% working with
text and about 10% something else." 

The most popular Github.com projects related to Perl right now
are:
1. A MySQL configuration script https://github.com/major/MySQLTuner-perl
2. A framework for building websites in Perl https://github.com/kraih/mojo
3. A VIM plugin for Perl: https://github.com/mileszs/ack.vim

*Resources*

For my work this semester, my primary resources will be "Learning Perl: 6th edition", the Perl
documentation: http://www.perl.org/docs.html, and other resources in the Perl community:
http://www.perl.org/community.html. I will probably also use StackOverflow.com if I get stuck, but I
will use that with caution as sometimes the answers are completely wrong.
